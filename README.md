# Python-PhotoMosiac
### A python program that creates an output image that looks similar to the input image out of source images
## How To Use
#### First install the required dependencies. Then put your main photos in the input folder and remove the defualt one, these are the images that will be turned into photomosiacs. Then input a large selection of varied images into the source folder. Try to include as many colours as possible as these are the images that will make up the output. Then simply run the program and enter your requirments. The final result will be in the output folder and any images that dont fit the size requirements will be moved to the wrongsize folder.
## What I Learned
#### For this program I furthered my knowledge of the PIL libary in python. I also learnt the ins and outs of image files in general. I learned how to manipulate image files and create new ones using arrays of rgb values. I also learned how to move and delete files using glob, os and shutil.
